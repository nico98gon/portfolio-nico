## Introduction

Before you take a look at the range of technologies I master, I want you to know that no matter which technology comes my way, rest assured, I will **learn** it. I like challenges, that is why I dedicate myself to the world of technology.

<Stack />

<div style={{ padding: '3%' }}>
    ### T-shaped profile

    It represents a combination of broad knowledge across multiple disciplines (represented by the horizontal part of the "T") and deep expertise in a specific area (represented by the vertical stem of the "T")


    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
        <Tshape />
    </div>


    As you can see, this is my current tech stack, which reflects my skills. I appreciate the idea of excelling in a specific area as it enables me to build with high quality and performance. However, I also believe that it's crucial to be familiar with technologies that are closely related to your own. This knowledge not only takes your work to the next level but also allows you to collaborate effectively with your team.
