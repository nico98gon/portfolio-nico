## Application Development

The development of the following application taught me how to create multiple routes with distinct styles. The primary focus was on learning, and I also acquired the skill of implementing search functionality. Additionally, I learned to ensure that when navigating to individual post pages, each post has its own unique URL.

### Testing

At first glance, it might appear to be a straightforward application, yet it offered me an extensive learning experience with React, routing, hooks, and the invaluable insight into constructing an application from scratch. The most captivating aspect, however, was the incorporation of testing, which truly elevated the course's comprehensiveness. The application underwent rigorous testing, encompassing authentication, both public and private routes, and a diverse array of types and styles.
