## Application Development

The application is fairly straightforward, serving as a personal diary where I acquired skills in user authentication using Firebase, implementing CRUD operations using the Firestore SDK, utilizing Redux for managing frontend data, crafting styles with MUI, and creating diverse layouts

### Testing

We conducted testing on the critical path of the application, enhancing our command of Jest and its implementation with best practices.
