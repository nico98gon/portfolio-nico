## How it started

For a long time, I had felt the urge to start a project, but I didn't want to initiate something merely for the sake of entrepreneurship. I had experienced it before, and the results weren't favorable; forcing things to happen rarely ends well. Additionally, I had been researching hardware for quite some time. During the pandemic, I delved deeply into this field. All of the above, combined with the sudden surge in cryptocurrencies in late 2020, sparked a strong interest in cryptocurrencies and their mining.

### My Journey into Cryptocurrency Mining

I had my desktop PC with a graphics card, and guided by my interest, a friend showed me how I could generate passive income in Ethereum by simply running a small program. Driven by curiosity, I conducted extensive research on cryptocurrencies and mining rigs, which eventually led me to persuade my first client, my dad, to purchase a mining rig.

### Scaling Up: From a Beginner's Mining Rig to an Expanding Fleet

My lack of experience was immediately noticeable when I first saw my rig, which was made of steel, had different models of graphics cards, and ran on Windows. Clearly, I corrected all of these mistakes later on. With the experience gained and the overwhelming initial results, we decided to make a more significant investment, expanding our fleet to just over 40 working graphics cards, which quickly grew to over 80.

### Building a Business: From Mining Rigs to a Collaborative Company

All this growth was accompanied by two friends, each contributing in different areas of a small company we were building around mining. We quoted and built mining rigs, covering everything from purchasing, hardware assembly, software installation, to maintenance - these were our services.

### Adapting to Cryptocurrency Changes

The business ran smoothly until Ethereum became unmineable due to its transition to a Proof of Stake system. The company dissolved, and we were forced to close as other cryptocurrencies that could still be mined with graphics cards didn't cover the minimum electricity costs.

### Lessons Learned

In conclusion, I can say that I gained significant knowledge in software, hardware, business, and human capital. It was a profound experience of continuous learning, with ups and downs along the way, but it provided invaluable lessons for personal growth.
