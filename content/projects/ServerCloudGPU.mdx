## Reviving GPU Potential Through Rental Services

When Ethereum mining was no longer profitable, I had to find a way to keep the graphics cards productive. After extensive research, I discovered how to achieve this through renting out graphics cards. It was complex, requiring reinvestment to modify the equipment, and this time I was on my own, but I managed to make the graphics cards available for rent through third-party software. This allowed me to ensure the GPUs didn't go to waste and extract performance from them.
