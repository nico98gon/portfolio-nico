## From Idea to Scalable Software Solution

Ever since it all started as a simple idea, we had a clear vision of the final outcome we aimed to achieve. Our goal was to create a practical application that truly addresses a **real-world** problem, while staying within the bounds of our technical expertise at the time. So, we put our heads together, sought feedback from people, and conducted research, eventually identifying a potential **gap** in the market. The idea had it all – it allowed us to learn with a challenging yet achievable level, provided the opportunity to work with the tools we were seeking to master, and yielded a software product with **scalability** potential for the future, and perhaps even the chance to enter the market.

### The Clear Vision: Building a People-Centric Marketplace

The idea was clear – a marketplace like Facebook, but with better connections among people. In our city, San Juan, there are two applications serving this purpose, widely embraced by the **community**. Thus, we had to find a way to address their shortcomings and create a software with distinct advantages over them. Starting at a disadvantage, as they already have a loyal user base, we needed to persuade their users to switch to our platform. To achieve this, we decided to first focus on the **foundation**, making it easier to tackle more complex aspects later. We emphasized design, technologies, user experience, performance, and overall app speed while adhering to best practices for future development. However, we knew that all of this wouldn't be enough.

### How To Capture Future Users

To successfully engage our future users, we must go beyond just UX/UI and speed. That's why, when developing the application, we made sure the code is scalable, allowing us to add valuable **features** that set us apart from the competition. Equally important is enabling other developers to work on the project with ease. We have envisioned several forthcoming functionalities, such as online stores, exclusive item shipping for members, adaptability for businesses, sales data and records, among others. In the short term, our target audience includes individuals looking to sell their used belongings, offer various services, and cater to small businesses. Looking ahead, our long-term goal is to establish a marketplace for San Juan, where all audiences can showcase their products and services, ranging from independent users to large enterprises.

### Catering to Customer Needs

We strive for the best for our clients, which is why we conducted a brief survey among various **users** of similar applications. Our goal was to understand their satisfaction levels, pain points, desired additions, and the reasons behind their choice of platforms. This valuable **research** provided us with insights on how to tailor our efforts, ensuring that the application aligns with customer needs and interests. We **discovered** that people sought clarity in their searches, desired enhanced precision and transparency, requested simplified messaging systems, and yearned for an improved interface and user experience.

### Flexible Business Model

Regarding our business model, we have brainstormed several **ideas**, including Google advertising, a freemium strategy, business plans, sponsored publications for positioning, and paid advanced features. However, we have chosen to remain flexible in our decision on this matter. We prefer to observe how the **community** adapts to the platform and gradually progress towards profitability as the user base grows and their needs become clearer.

### Empowering Our Project: The Evolution of Technology Choices

When it came to deciding the technologies for our project, we didn't spend much time contemplating and simply began building the application using the technologies we were most familiar with. In hindsight, this proved to be a significant **mistake**, as we failed to research the best options for the type of application we were constructing. After about a month and a half of coding, an experienced developer friend in the field reviewed the project and emphasized the benefits of integrating Next.js and TypeScript. After careful consideration, we decided to incorporate Next.js into the project. This decision presented an intriguing **challenge** since nobody on the team was familiar with this technology, leading to nearly a month of exclusive research, resulting in both obstacles and valuable lessons. Here, we outline the technologies utilized:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <div style={{ flex: '1', padding: '15px', paddingRight: 0 }}>
        - React
        - Next.js
        - Firebase and Firestore
        - Redux
        - Material UI
        - Javascript
        - CSS
        - HTML
        - pnpm
        - eslint 
        - git and github
    </div>

### From MVP to Closed Beta Testing

Currently, the project is in a testing phase, where our focus has been on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Our aim was to ensure that **essential** functionalities we considered as minimum requirements worked smoothly. As we are in the alpha version, there are, naturally, bugs and errors to address. Nevertheless, we are satisfied with the functionalities achieved thus far. Our next step is to proceed towards the closed beta phase, reinforcing code robustness with best practices and thoroughly testing the functionalities we have developed. Currently, the following functionalities are in place.

### Application Functionalities:

#### Authentication:

- Login and Register with user privileges.

#### Posts Management:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) of posts.
- List of posts with advanced filters (type, categories, subcategories).
- Advanced filters specific to each post type.
- Search functionality for posts.
- Individual post pages for detailed information.

#### Personalization:

- Suggested posts based on user preferences and interests.
- User pages for profile management.

#### Interaction:

- Ability to mark posts as favorites.

#### Additional Features:

- Create a new post page for users to add new listings.

### Embracing Challenges: Navigating Next.js and Growing as Web Developers

Throughout the journey, we encountered various challenges and faced crucial decision-making moments, which were always discussed and addressed by the three creators and developers working on the project. Solutions always emerged through thorough **research** on the issues at hand. Undoubtedly, the most daunting aspect to tackle was Next.js, from deciding whether to use it or not, selecting the appropriate version, navigating its nomenclature and app directory, to delving into server-side rendering, among many other complexities. Yet, we persistently confronted these challenges and forged ahead. We had to tackle Next.js and its beta version 13, which led us to delve into a wealth of invaluable **documentation**, even engaging with current bugs and **discussions** with Vercel's IT team. We encountered several obstacles with library compatibility for server-side rendering, such as Redux, Firebase, and especially MUI, the latter proving entirely incompatible when we had already built a significant portion of the graphical interface, posing a considerable challenge. Nevertheless, from all of this, we have learned immensely and grown in our knowledge of web development.

### Overcoming Challenges

Despite encountering various **difficulties**, we always strived to make the best possible decisions with the **available resources**, enabling us to achieve our objectives while adhering to best practices. We faced technical challenges with solutions unfamiliar to us, and the complexity lay in the multiple options for resolving each issue, making decision-making critical. The following is a list of the most significant **accomplishments** attained during the project's development.

- Incorporating Next.js 13 beta, despite compatibility issues with certain frameworks
- The team learning Next.js during development
- The team mastering problem-solving with unfamiliar challenges
- We create a Marketplace with a social network style
- Achieving all the above while maintaining best practices
- Gaining valuable insights from the entire experience"

### In Summary: Building a Scalable Web Marketplace from Scratch

In conclusion, we **created** a web marketplace application from the ground up, currently in its alpha version, utilizing the latest available libraries. Despite facing adversities, we remained steadfast in our vision and objectives, and constructed a scalable software product in a **healthy work environment**. In essence, we successfully transitioned from an idea and identifying a market gap to developing an unfinished product that is well on its way to fill that void.
