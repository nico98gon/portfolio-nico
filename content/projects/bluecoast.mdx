## Application Development

The idea came as a result of my first web development course (UTN fullstack), where I was tasked with creating a project, either fictitious or real. Since I've always enjoyed turning ideas into practical, real-world projects, I came up with the concept of building a website for my girlfriend's business, which was relatively new at the time. With a vague idea of the outcome, I embarked on the journey of creating an online platform that would make it easy for her to showcase her products.

### The journey

While I consider the project to be quite basic, it allowed me to solidify my knowledge in HTML and CSS. I learned a great deal about CSS, as I've always been interested in the idea of being creative with my development work. I appreciate aesthetics and minimalism, and I strive to create user experiences that are comfortable. Even though I had limited knowledge at the time, I believe that given my level of expertise, I managed to deliver a final product that aligned with my objectives.

### The result

The outcome was a very basic website with the capability to upload products via PHP and direct users to the social media profiles of the business. It's a modest achievement compared to my current skills, but at that time, it was the beginning of the path to what I've achieved today.
