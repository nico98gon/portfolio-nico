## Application Development

As stated in the description, the application was built using the MERN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. It's a collaborative calendar where users can create sessions and collaborate within it. User authentication and CRUD operations with MongoDB were implemented, providing valuable insights into backend development for this project.

### Testing

We conducted testing on the critical path of the application, enhancing our command of Jest and its implementation with best practices.
