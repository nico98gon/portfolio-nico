## What Is MiBot?

The platform involves users subscribing to different bots, each with varying prices and features. The software was integrated into Telegram Channels that provided signals for entering, adjusting, and exiting operations. If users wished to manually execute trades, they could do so for free, but keeping up with the bots' pace was challenging. To automate their trading, they had to subscribe to a monthly plan.

### How It Work?: Fostering a Trading Community

The project involves a third-party private bot that offers the service of connecting Trading View with a Telegram bot from the company Cornix. The private bot is configured to send entry, modification, or exit signals to the Cornix bot automatically when the market reaches certain values of different financial parameters. MiBot's service includes configuring the parameters of various bots, testing them with past and present data, approving these bots, and making them available to the community. MiBot's goal is to build a large community of users who practice trading techniques with the different offered bots, a community focused on collective profit and the refinement of various trading strategies.

### Nurturing a Thriving Community

When I created the project, I always had the vision that the community was the most important aspect. I wanted to build an active and passionate community for cryptocurrency trading with bots. People quickly started joining the project, making small but meaningful contributions. The Telegram bots began to yield significant results, as reflected in the statistics, and the community expanded rapidly.

### Training the Community through Comprehensive Documentation

To facilitate easy community access to information on how to use and configure the various bots, I decided to utilize Google Docs. Additionally, for those interested in automating their trades, I created another document explaining how to activate Cornix. I placed significant emphasis on developing a comprehensive guide that delved into the knowledge necessary for proper management of the entire platform. This way, I aimed to foster an empowered community ready for progress.

### Performance Monitoring with Telegram Channels

I set up a Telegram channel for bot statistics, allowing for a transparent view of each one's results. This channel serves as an effective means to track the performance of each bot, enabling us to deactivate those with poor results, adjust parameters for better performance, or deactivate them permanently. I also created a Google sheet that allowed us to analyze all the statistics and characteristics of each bot, to give more knowledge and detail to the community

### Transforming Profits: The Open Trial Success Story

After 3 months of internal testing with real money, I decided to launch the open trial. There were a few sign-ups, not many; we were six people testing the bots and their reactions to the market. The results were nothing short of incredible, with astonishing profit percentages that exceeded expectations. So, after the trial month, I started advertising with these results, and a lot of people joined the community, and everything was going great. Profits kept rolling in, and the community was expanding. For two months, the project's results were astounding.

### Navigating Market Shifts: The Decision to Pause the Project

As the community's growth was beginning to yield its fruits and results were getting better, the market started to change course, transitioning from a bear market to a sideways one. This sudden shift caught me off guard because the bots were not ready to operate in a bear market; their parameters needed adjustments. This forced me to deactivate the majority of them, and due to poor results, I found myself having to work very hard. But after much effort and dedication, I had to concede and completely pause the project. Running the project incurred fixed costs, not just for me but for the community as well. Trying to single-handedly manage bot creation, maintenance, community upkeep, marketing, and all the tasks required to keep the project running became impossible for me.

### A Journey of Learning and Growth

In conclusion, it was a tremendous learning experience that marked a before and after in many of my skills. I learned how to run and manage a virtual business, and I can take pride in the accomplishments I and community achieved. One of the projects I dedicated the most passion to. Who knows, maybe this isn't a 'goodbye,' but perhaps a 'see you later. I only paused the project, never deleted it.
