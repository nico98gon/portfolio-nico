## My artist touch: Professionalism and Creative Expression

When I envisioned creating my portfolio, my goal was to demonstrate the projects I have participated in, allowing potential future employers to gain a comprehensive view of the contributions I can make to various companies. Simultaneously, I aimed for a platform that would enable me to express my creativity and showcase the frontend UI skills I have developed through experience. To establish a distinctive style for my website, I chose to draw inspiration from various works while adapting them to my personal preferences. I incorporated those styles that required significant mastery efforts, styles I am genuinely proud of. They represent a segment of the visual quality I aspire to achieve in my work, and despite the challenges they posed, I find immense satisfaction in their accomplishment.

### Selected Technologies

Choosing the technologies wasn't overly complex; I simply needed to fulfill the requirements of creating a website with a few routes, simple functions, and a small database to store project views. I leaned toward the frameworks I'm most comfortable with. As a result, the following emerged:

- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Upstash
- Canvas
- contentlayer
- eslint
- pnpm

### Design Evolution

Regarding the design, I initially created a simple mockup using Procreate as a guide, and then proceeded to work on it iteratively. I was keen on incorporating the particle style I had learned from a Canvas course on Domestika. As development progressed, I refined the main design, implementing elements like a subtle blur at the beginning for smaller devices. Here, I've listed the sources that served as my inspiration. Feel free to explore them, as they offer valuable insights:

### Conclusion 

I must confess that I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. It offered ample opportunities for learning, and it was indeed a significant challenge to seamlessly integrate all these technologies, ensuring they functioned harmoniously and with the expected efficiency. I hope you found it as enjoyable as I did.
